# NotionAPI
Created API for future intergration with **Notion**.  Notion is considered to be a very powerful tool, and 
I aim to harness this power by the use of it's API and to use Notion in ways it was unthinkable before. 
I plan to integrate Notion with a blog site I am creating with **Next.js** and use it as a text editor and to 
fetch and store data.
